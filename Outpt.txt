Titulo:	Amivantamab, an Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and Mesenchymal-epithelial Transition Factor (MET) Bispecific Antibody, Designed to Enable Multiple Mechanisms of Action and Broad Clinical Applications.
Abstract:	Substantial therapeutic advancements have been made in identifying and treating activating mutations in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET) inhibitors remains common with current targeted therapies. Amivantamab, a fully human bispecific antibody targeting EGFR and MET, is approved in the United States and other countries for the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, for whom disease has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Preliminary efficacy and safety have also been demonstrated in patients with common EGFR- or MET-mutated NSCLC. Amivantamab employs 3 distinct potential mechanisms of action (MOAs) including ligand blocking, receptor degradation, and immune cell-directing activity, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and trogocytosis. Notably, efficacy with amivantamab does not require all 3 MOAs to occur simultaneously, broadening applicability by using diverse antitumor mechanisms. This review focuses on the molecular characteristics of amivantamab and its unique MOAs leading to in vitro and in vivo efficacy and safety in preclinical and clinical studies.

Titulo:	Possible heart failure caused by osimertinib in a lung cancer patient.
Abstract:	Osimertinib is a third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) indicated for the treatment of epidermal growth factor receptor mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It has demonstrated better results concerning effectiveness than other TKIs for the same indication. However, despite a good safety profile, it could produce some cardiotoxicity that does not occur with other drugs of the same group.
