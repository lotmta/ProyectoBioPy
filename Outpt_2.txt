Titulo:	Analysis of the Single-Cell Heterogeneity of Adenocarcinoma Cell Lines and the Investigation of Intratumor Heterogeneity Reveals the Expression of Transmembrane Protein 45A (TMEM45A) in Lung Adenocarcinoma Cancer Patients.
Abstract:	Intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) is responsible for the majority of difficulties encountered in the treatment of lung-cancer patients. Therefore, the heterogeneity of NSCLC cell lines and primary lung adenocarcinoma was investigated by single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF). First, we studied the single-cell heterogeneity of frequent NSCLC adenocarcinoma models, such as A549, H1975, and H1650. The intra- and inter-cell-line single-cell heterogeneity is represented in the expression patterns of 13 markers-namely GLUT1, MCT4, CA9, TMEM45A, CD66, CD274 (PD-L1), CD24, CD326 (EpCAM), pan-keratin, TRA-1-60, galectin-3, galectin-1, and EGFR. The qRT-PCR and CyTOF analyses revealed that a hypoxic microenvironment and altered metabolism may influence cell-line heterogeneity. Additionally, human primary lung adenocarcinoma and non-involved healthy lung tissue biopsies were homogenized to prepare a single-cell suspension for CyTOF analysis. The CyTOF showed the ITH of human primary lung adenocarcinoma for 14 markers; particularly, the higher expressions of GLUT1, MCT4, CA9, TMEM45A, and CD66 were associated with the lung-tumor tissue. Our single-cell results are the first to demonstrate TMEM45A expression in human lung adenocarcinoma, which was verified by immunohistochemistry.

Titulo:	Upregulation of TMEM45A Promoted the Progression of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma in vitro.
Abstract:	Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common and aggressive type of primary kidney cancer worldwide. Transmembrane protein 45A (TMEM45A) has been reported to be closely associated with the progression of several cancers. However, the role of TMEM45A in ccRCC remains unclear. Our study intended to explore the potential role of TMEM45A in ccRCC.

Titulo:	TMEM45A Affects Proliferation, Apoptosis, Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition, Migration, Invasion and Cisplatin Resistance of HPV-Positive Cervical Cancer Cell Lines.
Abstract:	To investigate the effects of transmembrane protein 45A (TMEM45A) on biological characteristics and cisplatin (DDP) resistance of cervical cancer cells. TMEM45A in cervical cancer cells and normal cervical epithelial cells (HCerEpiC) were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. HPV genotypes were identified by multiplex PCR. SiHa and HeLa cells were divided into Blank, shCTL, shTMEM45A-1, and shTMEM45A-2 groups, followed by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), EdU, Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, Wound healing, and Transwell invasion assays, as well as qRT-PCR and Western blotting. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide) was employed to evaluate the impact of TMEM45A shRNA on cisplatin-resistant cervical cancer cells (SiHa/DDP and HeLa/DDP). Compared with HcerEpic cell, cervical cancer cells exhibited the upregulation of TMEM45A expression, especially in HPV-positive cell lines (CaSki, SiHa, HeLa). TMEM45A shRNA suppressed the proliferation of SiHa and HeLa cells, arrested cells at the S phase, and promoted cell apoptosis. TMEM45A shRNA inhibited the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion, migration of SiHa and HeLa cells, accompanying by the downregulated Vimentin and N-cadherin with the upregulated E-cadherin. Moreover, SiHa/DDP and HeLa/DDP had higher TMEM45A expression than their parental SiHa and HeLa cells, respectively. And inhibiting TMEM45A can reduce the IC50 of SiHa/DDP cells and HeLa/DDP cells to cisplatin. Silencing TMEM45A can inhibit cell proliferation, invasion, migration and EMT, regulate cell cycle distribution, promote cell apoptosis, and reverse cisplatin resistance of HPV-positive cervical cancer cells, highlighting that inhibition of TMEM45A may be a therapeutic strategy for HPV-positive cervical cancer.
